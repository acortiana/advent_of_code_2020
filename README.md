# advent_of_code_2020

This is my code for advent of code 2020.
It's quick and dirty code, unoptimized, slow, with no comments and bad naming of both variables and functions.
Probably I reinvented the wheel countless times in this code but... who cares?

When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing
Now, God only knows
